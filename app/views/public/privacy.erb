    <p style="font-size:2em;">
    We collect and maintain different types of personal information about individuals with whom we interact, which is relevant for purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate for online checkouts (“online checkouts”).
    
    This includes:<br /><br />
    Contact and identification information, such as the User’s name, address, telephone number and e-mail address; Financial information such as the User’s payment methods and preferences, billing and banking information (credit card number and expiry date); Product and service related information concerning the sale of online checkouts and other products or services that are provided to the User; Other personal information used for purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in light of the circumstances.
    <br /><br />
    As a general rule, Ongair collects the User’s personal information directly from the User and will generally not collect personal information about the User from a third party without such User’s consent. A User may have given such consent directly to Ongair or to the third party dealing directly with Ongair.<br />

    <p style="font-size:2em;">
    It is important to Ongair that it only collects, uses or discloses the User’s personal information which is
    not publicly available, where we have the User’s consent to do so. Depending on the sensitivity of the personal information, the User’s consent may be implied, deemed (using an opt-out mechanism) or express. Express consent can be given orally, electronically or in writing. Implied consent is consent
    that can reasonably be inferred from the User’s action or inaction.
